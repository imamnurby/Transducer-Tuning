```
python process_json.py \ 
    --train_file train.json \   # Specify the path to the training JSON file
    --eval_file eval.json \     # Specify the path to the evaluation JSON file
```

Make sure that you have downloaded the data from the [prior work](https://github.com/NougatCA/FineTuner). If you have not, then download the `train.json` and `eval.json` and put those files in this directory.
